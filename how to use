1.	Setup the Environment:
Ensure you have the required libraries installed by following the setup instructions in requirements.txt.
Required libraries include:
	•	transformers
	•	torch
	•	nltk
	•	rank_bm25
	•	sentencepiece
	2.	Prepare Your Book:
Place your book or document in a .txt format. This file should be passed to the pipeline as book_path when running the script.
	3.	Run the Pipeline:
To ask a question and get an answer, use the qa_pipeline function. 
EXAMPLE:
question = "What did Alice find in the bottle?"
book_path = "sample_book.txt"  # path to the text file
answer = qa_pipeline(question, book_path)
print("Question:", question)
print("Answer:", answer)

  4.	Understanding the Output:
The answer generated by the model will be printed based on the most relevant chunks retrieved from the book.
