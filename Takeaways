From a studentâ€™s perspective, building the Search-based Language Model (SLM) pipeline was an insightful experience that combined multiple techniques like text preprocessing, retrieval, and answer generation. I learned how crucial efficient text chunking and the BM25 retrieval system are for pulling out relevant context from large documents. I also encountered some challenges with dependency management and ensuring all required libraries were installed, but this helped me understand the importance of maintaining a clean environment when working with machine learning models. Overall, this task enhanced my understanding of natural language processing (NLP) systems, the importance of proper tokenization, and how pre-trained models like T5 can be effectively used for generating meaningful answers.
